FINAL PROJECT STRUCTURE (13 essential files):
- 3 agent files (my_team*.py)
- 5 training files (parallel_training.sh, distributed_training.py, etc.)
- 2 tool files (compare_agents.py, requirements.txt)
- 2 docs (README.md, USAGE.txt)

✅ Pause/resume training
✅ Multi-core support (1-10000+ cores)
✅ Distributed training across machines
✅ Automatic checkpointing
✅ Agent comparison tools
✅ Complete documentation in README.md
✅ Quick reference in USAGE.txt

NEXT STEPS:
1. Read: cat USAGE.txt
2. Test: ./parallel_training.sh 2 10
